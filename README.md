# 360Convert
360Convert is a app that works with VALORANT to pull the player's in game sensitivity, and display the amount of cm (or inches) it would take to perform an in-game 360 degree turn, aka cm/360. Implementation would also include being able to convert VALORANT sensitivities to other games, and vice versa.
